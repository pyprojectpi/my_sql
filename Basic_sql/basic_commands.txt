SQL Commands Cheatsheet with Detailed Descriptions

1. DDL (Data Definition Language)
---------------------------------
DDL commands are used to define, modify, and remove database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas. 
These commands deal with the structure of the database, not the actual data.

CREATE
------
Used to create a new database object such as a table, view, or index.
Example:
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    Course VARCHAR(50)
);

ALTER
-----
Used to modify the structure of an existing database object.
Example: Add a new column to Students table
ALTER TABLE Students ADD Email VARCHAR(100);

DROP
----
Used to permanently delete a database object such as a table.
Example:
DROP TABLE Students;

TRUNCATE
--------
Used to remove all rows from a table quickly, but keeps the table structure for future use.
Example:
TRUNCATE TABLE Students;

RENAME
------
Used to rename an existing database object.
Example:
ALTER TABLE Students RENAME TO Learners;


2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)
-----------------------------------
DML commands are used to manipulate data stored in the database. 
They allow users to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data.

SELECT
------
Retrieves data from one or more tables.
Example:
SELECT * FROM Students;

INSERT
------
Adds new rows of data into a table.
Example:
INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age, Course)
VALUES (1, 'Surya', 21, 'ECE');

UPDATE
------
Modifies existing records in a table.
Example:
UPDATE Students
SET Age = 22
WHERE StudentID = 1;

DELETE
------
Removes specific rows from a table based on a condition.
Example:
DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 1;

MERGE
-----
Used to insert new rows or update existing ones depending on whether a condition is met.
Example:
MERGE INTO Students S
USING (SELECT 1 AS StudentID, 'Arun' AS Name, 23 AS Age, 'CSE' AS Course) AS Temp
ON (S.StudentID = Temp.StudentID)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET S.Name = Temp.Name, S.Age = Temp.Age
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (StudentID, Name, Age, Course)
    VALUES (Temp.StudentID, Temp.Name, Temp.Age, Temp.Course);

LOCK TABLE
----------
Locks a table to prevent other users from accessing it while a transaction is ongoing.
Example:
LOCK TABLE Students IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;


3. DCL (Data Control Language)
------------------------------
DCL commands are used to control access to data in the database. 
They define privileges and permissions for users.

GRANT
-----
Gives a user or role specific privileges such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.
Example:
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Students TO user1;

REVOKE
------
Removes previously granted privileges from a user or role.
Example:
REVOKE INSERT ON Students FROM user1;


4. TCL (Transaction Control Language)
-------------------------------------
TCL commands are used to manage transactions in a database. 
Transactions ensure that a group of SQL statements are executed as a single unit of work.

COMMIT
------
Saves all changes made by a transaction permanently in the database.
Example:
INSERT INTO Students VALUES (2, 'Kumar', 20, 'IT');
COMMIT;

ROLLBACK
--------
Undoes all changes made by the current transaction, restoring the database to its previous state.
Example:
DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 2;
ROLLBACK;  -- Undo delete

SAVEPOINT
---------
Creates a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back, without affecting the entire transaction.
Example:
SAVEPOINT before_update;
UPDATE Students SET Age = 25 WHERE StudentID = 1;
ROLLBACK TO before_update;
